SensorLibrary
=============

a [RedstoneChips](http://eisental.github.com/RedstoneChips) circuit library containing sensor chips.

#### Circuits in library
- pirsensor - a PIR (Passive Infra-red) heat sensor for detecting living entities within a radius.
- photocell - Detect the average light level around the chip's interface blocks.
- daytime - Can output all kinds of real or game time measurements.
- rangefinder - An ultrasonic transceiver for detecting the exact distance between the chip and anything.
